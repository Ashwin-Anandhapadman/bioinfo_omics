# A predictive machine learning model for prostrate cancer


This folder contains the code written by me to perform proteomic data analysis using machine learning models. The dataset is obtained from the research paper: https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c05487.

I have tried to replicate the analysis as proposed by the authors in the research paper. This ML pipeline finds the best set of features from the dataset and identifies potential proteomic biomarkers for Prostrate cancer.

## More details on the project:
The research paper used 133 EPS-urine patient samples for performing prostrate cancer predictive analysis.

A machine learning (ML) pipeline aimed at feature selection and the identification of significant patterns was designed. This pipeline utilizes a voting mechanism that ensembles multiple ML models, resulting in improved average prediction performance.
