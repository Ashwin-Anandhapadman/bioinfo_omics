This folder contains the code written by me to perform proteomic data analysis using machine learning models. The dataset is obtained from the research paper: https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c05487.

I have tried to replicate the analysis as proposed by the authors in the research paper. This ML pipeline finds the best set of features from the dataset and identifies potential proteomic biomarkers for Prostrate cancer.
